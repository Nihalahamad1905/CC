Experiment No 6
What are selective re-test techniques? How are they different from the ‘retest all’ technique? 
Discuss the priority category schemes for the prioritization of test cases. What is the role of risk matrix for the reduction of test cases? 
How is risk analysis used in testing? How can we prioritize test cases using risk factor? 
What is a risk matrix? How do we assign thresholds that group the potential problems into priority categories? 
Explain the following: (a) Modification traversing test cases (b) Modification revealing test cases 
What is the difference between general test case prioritization and version specific test case prioritization? Discuss any prioritization technique with the help of an example. 
Explain the ‘code coverage prioritization’ technique. What are the test cases selection criteria? Write the modification algorithm which is used to minimize and prioritize test cases


Assignment No 7
What are the various levels of testing? Explain the objectives of every level. Who should do testing at every level and why? 
What is scaffolding? Why do we use stubs and drivers during unit testing? 
What are the various steps to minimize the coupling amongst various units? Discuss different types of coupling from the best coupling to the worst coupling. 
 Compare the top down and bottom up integration testing approaches to test a program. 
What is debugging? What are the popular debugging approaches? Write features of these techniques and compare the important features. 
Explain the significance of debugging tools. List some commercially available debugging tools.
